Agenda: generate ideas yay

Why not the umbrella game?
Tailored for multiplayer (skill based)
To one-player: make rain random
can't do anything about randomness
(Jino: reason you die is because you took the risk, not because of the game's function)

Genres:
Sci-fi - text heavy

Ideas:
- janitor in Ateneo sweeping leaves off roofs, avoid sweeping leaves onto students
- runner game, platformer, can only run on certain colors unless you go through a portal to change color
